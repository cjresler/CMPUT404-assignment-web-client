*Ryan Satyabrata - I read his code found here: https://github.com/kobitoko/CMPUT404-assignment-web-client/blob/master/httpclient.py to help me understand how to approach aspects of the assignment. I also used some of his code directly from his github.

I referenced the following pages to help me understand certain functions:
